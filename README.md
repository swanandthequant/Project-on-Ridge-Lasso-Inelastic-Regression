## datasets
I used a very Good Dataset of Algerian forest Fires From online sources

## Methodolody
1.Data cleaning
2.EDA
3.Feature Engineering
4.Model Training(I just did the implementation of multiple Regression as there was no need of data cleaning in this)
5.Model Evaluation (using mean_squared_error,mean_absolute_error,root_mean_squared_error,R2_score,Residuals)
6.pickling
7.Making a site for this Prediction


## what I learned
by this project it was medium Level project But I learned about Ridge,Lasso,Inelastic,simple Linear Regresssion 
Their Cross Validation models which are very imp in Machine Learning

## Project Updates
This the second model of Regression as I have uploaded the Multiple lInear Regressio model 
Thank you everyone Swanand patil
